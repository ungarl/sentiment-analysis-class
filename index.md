Sentiment Analysis of User-generated Content

The proliferation of user generated content on the Web is driving a
new wave of work determining user sentiment from web texts such as
message boards, blogs, tweets, and Facebook status updates. Both
researchers and practitioners are developing and applying new methods
to determine how users feel about everything: products and
politicians, friends and family, scientific articles and
celebrities. This short course will cover the state of the art in this
rapidly growing area, including recent advances that combine
information extraction with sentiment analysis to improve accuracy in
assessing sentiment about specific entities, and use of NLP to
understand people's personality and health behaviors.
Real world applications of sentiment analysis will be presented.
